I'm making a massively mutliplayer game of epic proportions. It will be one of the best games you have ever played. It is a top down, story rich || not fantasy and sci-fi RPG,
with elements from minecraft, factorio, dungeon defenders, mobas and rts games, and first person shooters

It will take a while, but here are some screenshots. Eventually I want to get to a point where I can make a kickstarter. I would like to work on this full time.
